INTRODUCTION
------------

Jeditable(jEditable inline editing module) provides "click to edit" functions
for standard text, numeric, and email formatters used on entities.

So what is this good for? it provides a very quick and easy way to update the
things they need to change without having to edit specific fields without
having to switch to the full-blown node editor.

INSTALLATION
--------------------------

Install the module like any other Drupal module.
Optionally, you can choose to install the 2.0+ version of Jeditable locally,
in the /libraries/jquery-jeditable folder. Otherwise, a CDN will be used.

CONFIGURATION
--------------------------

1. Turn on the "use jeditable" permission for all rolls you want to have access
 to jeditable operations.

2. Go to the "display settings" of your node, or into the display settings for
a view with fields in it and, for the supported formatters,
click the 'Enable jeditable' checkbox.

3. Finally, load a node, "click to edit", and enjoy!
